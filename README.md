# traffic_simulation
Thesis aimed at creating an AI capable of monitoring and selecting the best traffic light phases at a given intersection.

This project begins with the development and training of YOLO for the specific intersection, which facilitates an automated strategy for data collection. YOLO will be able to take five-minute videos of traffic flow, processing them to count vehicles and their passage times between two specific points.

Next, the data obtained will be used to create a digital twin of the chosen intersection. This simulation will include a traffic light system that will be improved by AI capable of finding the best phases and avoiding road congestion.
